### Welcome to My RoamResearch Repo 👋

**My goal with this repo is two fold:**

1. Focus quality over QTY
2. Make the code easy to understand and use

To accomplish these goals, I've segmented each unique modification into it's own file. This allows for easy onboarding of code along with easy customization. 

**This repo is a collection CSS and JavaScript snippets that work with Roam Research**
I've only included snippets that I've found value in personally or watched others get value from. 
> I've curated a collection of my own code that along other developers. If the source is from another developer, I've copied _and given credit within_. This was to ensure things did not change _without my knowledge_ and to add notes to simplify. 
>> _As a note, if you come across this repo and credit is mis-represented please let me know!_.

    - This is a fork of [MatthieuBizen's repo 🧠](https://github.com/MatthieuBizien/roam-to-git), who brilliantly built a free 'stress free' utility that takes the guess work and complexity out of backing up.
